Telco Customer Churn Prediction

About Dataset
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, refers to a situation where a customer stops doing business with a company or a business, either by cancelling their subscription, discontinuing a service or stopping the purchase of a product. This can occur due to various factors, such as dissatisfaction with the quality of service, pricing, competition, or other reasons.

Customer churn is a significant problem for businesses as it can result in a decrease in revenue and a tarnished reputation. Therefore, companies prioritize customer satisfaction as a critical factor in preventing customer churn.
